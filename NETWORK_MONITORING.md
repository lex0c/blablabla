## Associated Processes

To show the processes associated with established connections using the `ss` command, you can use the `-p` option, which stands for "process." The `-p` option will display the process ID (PID) and process name associated with each socket.

### For TCP Connections:

```sh
ss -ntp state established
```

- **`-n`**: Displays numeric addresses and port numbers.
- **`-t`**: Specifies TCP sockets.
- **`-p`**: Shows the process using the socket.
- **`state established`**: Filters to show only established connections.

### For UDP Connections:

```sh
ss -nup state established
```

- **`-u`**: Specifies UDP sockets.

### For Both TCP and UDP:

```sh
ss -ntulp state established
```

### Notes:

- **Permissions**: You might need to run the command as the root user to see the process information for sockets opened by other users.

  ```sh
  sudo ss -ntulp state established
  ```

## Process Info

To get process information based on a PID (Process ID), you can use various commands and tools available in Unix-like operating systems such as Linux. Here are some methods to retrieve process information:

### 1. **Using the `ps` Command:**

The `ps` command is used to display information about active processes. You can use it with various options to customize the output.

```sh
ps -p <PID> -f
```

- **`-p`**: Specifies the PID of the process you are interested in.
- **`-f`**: Provides a full-format listing, which includes additional details such as UID, PID, PPID, C, STIME, TTY, TIME, and CMD.

### 2. **Using the `/proc` Filesystem:**

The `/proc` filesystem contains directories named after each PID, containing various files with detailed information about each process.

```sh
cat /proc/<PID>/status
```

- This will display a lot of details about the process, such as the UID, GID, state, and memory usage.

### 3. **Using the `top` Command with a Specific PID:**

You can use the `top` command with the `-p` option followed by a specific PID to monitor that process in real-time.

```sh
top -p <PID>
```

### 4. **Using the `htop` Command and Searching for a PID:**

`htop` is an interactive process viewer. You can run `htop` and then search for a specific PID.

```sh
htop
```

- After running `htop`, you can press `F3` or `/` and enter the PID to search for it.

### 5. **Using the `pgrep` and `pkill` Commands:**

- `pgrep` can be used to find the PID of a process based on its name.
- `pkill` allows you to signal processes based on their names.

### 6. **Using `pstree` to See the Process Tree:**

`pstree` displays the running processes as a tree. You can use it to see the hierarchy of processes.

```sh
pstree <PID>
```
